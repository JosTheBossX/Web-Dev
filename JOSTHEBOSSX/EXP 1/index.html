<p>Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin) is an advanced transformation assumed by members and hybrids of the Saiyan race with sufficient amounts of S-Cells in the Dragon Ball franchise. Earthlings (of Saiyan heritage) in Dragon Ball Online can also assume the transformation by wishing to have their dormant Saiyan powers unlocked.
The Super Saiyan form first premiered in April 1991, within chapter 317 of the Dragon Ball manga, entitled "Life or Death". It also made its anime debut in 1991, first appearing in Dragon Ball Z episode 95, "Transformed at Last". Within Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, three further powered up transformations: the second[14][15] and third[16][17] forms succeed Super Saiyan, while the premier form also has two additional graded states[18] that focus on power, and also the final form[19][20] which is superior to the graded forms. The original Super Saiyan form can also be mastered[21] to improve some of its traits and remove some flaws.

<p>
    Super Saiyan 2 (超スーパーサイヤ人じん２ツー Sūpā Saiya-jin Tsū), initially referred to as Super Saiyan Fifth Grade at the time of it's debut,[1] though referred to as "Ascended Super Saiyan" in the Funimation Dub only, is the direct successor to the first Super Saiyan transformation. It is very similar to the original form in appearance and attainment; however, the power output is far greater, as speed, strength, and energy output all drastically increase.

Gohan is the first person to attain the form in the manga and the anime, and he uses it while fighting against Cell in the Cell Games. Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks soon follow. Goku trains to achieve it in the Other World, while both Vegeta and Future Trunks reach the form by training on Earth. Caulifla attains this form right after becoming a Super Saiyan and is the first female Super Saiyan 2.

    Super Saiyan 3

<p>
    Super Saiyan 3 (超スーパーサイヤ人じん３スリー Sūpā Saiya-jin Surī) is the third form of Super Saiyan and the successor to the second transformation. This form extracts every drop of potential from a Saiyan's blood. Goku was the first to achieve the form and was able to do so after several years of vigorous training in Other World. Gotenks later achieves this form through the power of Trunks and Goten's fusion and Goku's example.

<h2>
    Super Saiyan 4
</h2>

<p>
    The only way a Saiyan can attain Super Saiyan 4 is if they have a high enough power level and become a Golden Great Ape (or Broly's variant) and regain conscious control over the form. Even after this form is attained, it cannot be accessed at will and requires exposure to Blutz Waves every time the user wishes to transform, however, Goku is apparently a special case, capable of using the form whenever he wishes.[6] In Dragon Ball Heroes Gohan acquired the form without a tail while training, and Xeno Trunks was originally going to have acquired the form too showing that even Half-Saiyans born without tails can still acquire Super Saiyan 4.
